    <p>CityQuest ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application and related services.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    
    <h3>1.1. Location Data</h3>
    <p><strong>Calculated Position:</strong> We collect and process your precise location data (GPS coordinates) <strong>only while you are using the application</strong> to enable the core "Fog of War" exploration gameplay. This data is used to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reveal map areas on your device.</li>
        <li>Calculate distance traveled for scoring.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Storage:</strong> Individual GPS points are stored locally on your device. We do NOT upload your full GPS history to our servers. We only upload aggregated data (score, total distance, league status) to the leaderboard.</p>

    <h3>1.2. Account Information</h3>
    <p>If you choose to create an account via Google or Email (Supabase Auth), we collect:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Email address</li>
        <li>Publicly visible Username (which you choose)</li>
        <li>Avatar preference</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Gameplay:</strong> To update your map visibility and track progress.</li>
        <li><strong>Leaderboards:</strong> To display your score, distance, and username to other players globally.</li>
        <li><strong>Account Sync:</strong> To allow you to access your progress across multiple devices.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use the following third-party services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Supabase:</strong> For authentication and database hosting. (See <a href="https://supabase.com/privacy">Supabase Privacy Policy</a>)</li>
        <li><strong>DiceBear:</strong> To generate random avatar images based on your username or seed.</li>
        <li><strong>OpenStreetMap / Carto:</strong> For map tile data (visual display only).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
    <p>Your game data is retained as long as your account is active. You may request deletion of your account and all associated data by contacting us at support@cityquest.app or using the delete option within the app (if available).</p>
    <p>Local data on your device can be cleared by uninstalling the application or clearing browser storage.</p>
